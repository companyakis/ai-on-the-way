To summarize, an Agent is a system that uses an AI Model (typically an LLM) as its core reasoning engine, to:

Understand natural language: Interpret and respond to human instructions in a meaningful way.

Reason and plan: Analyze information, make decisions, and devise strategies to solve problems.

Interact with its environment: Gather information, take actions, and observe the results of those actions.
