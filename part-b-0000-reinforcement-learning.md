We can summarize RL:


# 1. Initialize the Environment and the Initial State
env = create_environment()
state = env.get_initial_state()

# 2. Start the Main Loop
for i in range(n_iterations):
    # 3. Choose an Action based on the Current State
    action = choose_action(state)

    # 4. Execute the Action and Get Feedback
    new_state, reward = env.execute(action)
    
    # 5. Update the Agent's Knowledge
    update_knowledge(state, action, reward)
    
    # 6. Move to the New State for the Next Iteration
    state = new_state
    
    # Optional: Check for Termination Condition
    # You can break the loop if the new_state is a terminal state.
    # if env.is_terminal(new_state):
    #    break
